//Trie or Prefix tree is a very important data structure used in the current world.
/*
  Why cant we use HashMaps for tring searches?
 - Cannot retrieve all prefixes.
 - If multiple strings are being stored, space restriction and it may seem like we are performing an O(n) search.

// Efficient search, prefix_match can be done using Trie.
Applicns:-
1. Google Search
2. Boggle game (word puzzle)
3. word document, autocorrection
4. Ip address routing (Longest prefix match)

// We can efficiently implemnet a Trie in Java
