// There's a trick to solve this problem in 1 line.
// Just take a small 4 stone example.
// clearly alex can take either first + third or second + fourth
// This means Alex can win by either of the two approaches.
// The output would be Alex will win always.


// It becomes trickier if the number of inputs is odd.
// We need to come up with a DP approach.
